        <h2> Biography</h2>
        <p>Mother Teresa (1910–1997), born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu in Skopje, was a Catholic nun and missionary who dedicated her life to serving the poor and sick. In 1950, she founded the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India, an order focused on helping the “poorest of the poor.” She became renowned for her work with the dying, lepers, and marginalized communities around the world.

            Her selfless service earned her numerous honors, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979. Mother Teresa was widely admired for her humility and compassion. She passed away in 1997 and was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 2016.</p>
